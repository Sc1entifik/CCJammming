- v-0.0.0.0.1 - Initial commit nothing done.
- v-0.3 - Built Input validation function for using the Spotify Search api. Built class to use the Spotify API. Enum built containing Spotify endpoints. .env file made.
- v-0.3.5 - Finished class to obtain access token from an access code. Built some data fetching methods using access token. Loaded custom font for Header on page. 
- v-0.3.8 - Refactored authorization and api fetching class to two separate classes with composition having the api fetching class use the authorization class to get the authorization header it needs to make api calls. Made interfaces so objects and list returned from the SpotifyApi class have proper methods and return types. Added custom styling fonts and created color pairs for website. 
- v-0.5 - Fixed bug where using the search bar resulted in Spotify passing a bad oAuth header. Wrote code for writing to and reading from an oAuthHeader.json file to utilize headers returned from Spotify on page refresh. Added search bar component. 
- v-0.6 - Learned how to use cookies to store the header data which is more efficient than writing the JSON method on the server. This streamlined the process greatly. Also removed the now unnecessary oAuthHeader.json file. Added a few more fetch methods and interfaces to the SpotifyApiFetch class.
- v-0.6.3 - Added Artist album component which is a collapsable component that shows the looked up artist albums and then expands and shows the album track when clicked on.
- v-0.6.6 - Added Playlist component which shows each playlist that the user can modify by filtering the user's playlists by the playlists that they can modify. 
- v-0.7 - Refactored Layout.ts so that the nav bar shows whether or not you are connected to your Spotify account and allows you to connect and disconnect it. Added server action for deleting browser cookie by disconnect link. Refactored Spotify Login Authorization to a server action instead of an API endpoint. Refactored client side fetching to use functions instead of classes. Wrote tests for client side fetches. Discovered and fixed Underground Artist Data Bug as detailed below.  Refactored various functional components.
- v-0.7.2 - Refactored all elements to use new fetching system. Removed old fetching system. Removed unnecessary helper component files. Wrote more tests for fetching system.
- v-0.7.5 - Wrote fetch and test for album form query. Added Album fetch to form radio button. Refactored albumCollapse.tsx to show artist for every album. Renamed ArtistAlbumSongGrid to AlbumSongGrid and renamed artistAlbumGrid.tsx to albumGrid.tsx. 
- v-0.7.6 - Wrote fetch and test for song form query. Wrote Functional components for song lookup.
- v-0.7.8 - Wrote fetch for user playlists. Wrote fetch for user account. Filtered playlists for only playlists the user owns and can modify. Created a separate page route for selecting playlists. Created a hidden link in layout.ts that shows up after user connects their spotify account which links to the setCurrentPlaylist route. Created "use server" function inside of map object that sets the currentPlaylist cookie which stores a playlist id. Moved some functional components to their local routes.
- v-0.8 - Created new fetches that can look up playlists by playlist id. Created functional components to display the current playlist and it's contents. The setCurrentPlaylist route now displays current playlist once chosen. 
- v-0.82 - Added unfollowCurrentPlaylist server function which uses a delete fetch to unfollow the "current playlist", deletes the "currentPlaylist" cookie and then redirects the user back to the set CurrentPlaylist page which keeps the page from erroring out due to the "currentPlaylist" cookie returning undefined to the fetch playlistId variable sent to the fetchPlaylistById function. Added functional component for a button to unfollow current playlist from the setCurrentPlaylist route. Changed Jammming header at the top of the page to a clickable link to the home page.
- v-0.83 - Added form for adding playlists to your list of playlists. Added AddTracksToPlaylist functional component which allows adding of songs to current playlist. Added AddTracksToPlaylist to songsGrid.tsx. Song lookup now can add tracks to playlist. 
- v-0.84 - Adding tracks now displays inside of playlist in real time using redirect from the server action. Fixed bottom margin on current playlist so there is now space between the last item of the playlist and the bottom of the page. Current Playlist items are now buttons which will remove the track from the playlist when clicked. Rerouting has been handled so page seems to update in real time.
- v-0.86 - Artist Top Tracks and Current Playlist now scroll independently of the main page. Scroll position on these elements maintain after page refresh. Added Snap scrolling on Artist Top Tracks and Current Playlist.
- v-0.86-0001 - Discovered two bugs which I have not solved yet. After trying to make some changes I found the codebase somewhat fragile and in need of refactoring. To my horror when I tried to create a refactor branch from the main branch the website would not load. I am making a merge and push to the repository so I can open a working refactoring branch.
- v-0.86.5 - Refactored commonFetches.ts to now have .catch functions which console.errors the fetch which failed and the error message. Fixed common_fetch_test.ts incorrectly using a for in loop instead of a for of loop. Moved various components to their own folders and ones used by multiple routs into a common component folder location.
- v-0.88 - Fixed Removing Tracks From Playlist Causes Type Error Bug. Added fetch caching for fetchAlbumTracksById. Fixed <Image> tag sizing throughout project. Artist Albums and Album search elements now scroll independent of page.
- v-0.88.5 - Rounded track and album images. Added priority to large images above the fold. Moved search bar to top of page (not sure if this is permenant). Set max height on various elements so there is no scroll bar on full page.
- v-0.9 - Created media queries for main page. Created siteMap enum to store page routes. Created useNavBarComponents.tsx hook.Created hamburger menu for screen sizes less than medium screen sizes. Refactored navBarComponents.tsx and siteNavigationMenu.tsx component inside of hamburgerMenu.tsx to use the useNavBarComponents.tsx hook. Got rid of unnecessary functional components used in previous nav bar design.
- v-0.92 - Created OEmbed Enum for OEmbed endpoints. Not sure if this will make the final cut. Built Functional component for IFrame embed element. Only seems to embed previews of songs but does work on any version of Spotify so this looks like a win. Added player embed element for song player.
- v-0.92.3 - Fixed Delete Item from Playlist 502 Bug. Refactored Song search to scroll in place with no scroll bars. Songs element now uses client based fetching so prop drilling should now work with client based component. Snap scroll styling added to Songs Functional Component.
- v-0.93 - Fixed Player Won't Load For New Song Bug. Also moved fetches back to server side fetching which speeds things up. Made createSampleTrackUriCookie server action. Refactored songs to scroll through tracks and use snap scrolling while still using server side fetch. Album and ArtistAlbums fetches now have play samples. Refactored ArtistAlbums and Album functional components to have nice looking scrolls.
- v-0.94 - Deleted unnecessary functional components. Made scrolling look better. Added play samples to Artist Top Tracks.
- v-0.95 - Added changePlaylistNameAndDescription server fetch. Made PlaylistNameAndDescription functional component update the playlist name and description via the server fetch function. Created Sitemap enum entry for reorderPlaylist path. Added Reorder Playlist to site navigation menu. Added SetCurrentPlaylist message component to allow user to redirect to setCurrentPlaylist route if no current playlist is set. Created playlistReorder.tsx functional component for playlist reordering. Created useElementUriHashmap.ts hook to create hashmap element to link rendered elements to their cooresponding uri values so I can transform an ordered list of elements to spotify uris to put into the playlist reorder api. Created trackGrid.tsx component to organize track element to a picture and a song name in a 2-col grid format. Made backend fetch updatePlaylistItems that will take a list of spotify uris and write them in order to your playlist replacing your playlist with the new reordered one. Hooked up Reorder Playlist button to updatePlaylistItems server action to enable playlist reordering after user drags their playlist around in the order they want it.
- v-0.96 - Solved Playlist GET Request 100 Track Max bug. Refactored fetchPlaylistItemsById fetch to be a reciprocol function in order to get any number of playlist items. Refactored updatePlaylistItems to be called from a higher order function called reorderPlaylistItems to get around Spotify's 100 track limitation on the endpoint called there. I also use a function called addTracksToPlaylist from reorderPlaylists. Using both of these functions in tandem duplicates all the wanted functionality and is cleaner than using Spotify's update playlist items endpoint their inteded way with all the optional paramaters.
- v-1 - Made minor refactors to make site more visually appealing. Now ready for deployment.


Bug Fixes:
- Search Bar Refresh - Bug triggered when page refresh happened from form submit. This triggered another oAuth header request which results in an invalid header. Fixed this by saving the header to a JSON file and then retrieving it. Later switched to a cookie based system.

- Underground Artist Data Bug - Bug triggered when looking for a lesser known artist by name which has a similar name to a well known artist thus causing the more well known artist data to get returned instead. Fixed this by filtering for artist name on list with .find() and then returning res.items[0] only when res.items.find() variable is undefined.

- Adding Tracks With Client Components - Bug triggered when trying to use the AddTracksToPlaylist functional component inside a "use client" functional component. Reason for bug was importing cookies from nextjs/headers from within a "use client" component. To fix this issue I moved the "use server" handle click function to the serverActions.ts file and then imported it from the addTracksToPlaylist.tsx. This makes everything work just fine. I however am not sure what real difference doing any of this actually makes.

- Music Form Search Bar Causing Faulty Redirects - Bug triggered when searching for tracks using the musicForm.tsx component when going to the home page directly from typing it in the url bar as opposed to clicking on the home link at the top of the header. This was caused do to how the form variabled are unpacked inside the createRedirectCookie function using formData.values(). For an unknown reason when you go to the home page by typing in the url address an extra keypair got added to the formData variable causing formData.values to unpack incorrectly. I fixed this by unpacking the variables separately key by key and using ternary statements to handle falsey values.

- Removing Tracks From Playlist Causes tracks.map() To Cause TypeError - When removing tracks from the current playlist and the view was showing collapsable albums the page rerender would cause the tracks list to be undefined causing a type error. I fixed this by moving the fetches to a server component and then sending the fetch results to a second .map() function after the first.

- 502 Deletion Bug - Recent change to Spotify API causes a 502 Bad Gateway status message when trying to delete items from playlist while supplying the snapshot ID. This would not trigger an actual error message so this was very troublesome to spot and fix. The fix to this was to remove the snapshot ID from the request which also speeds up the request as well. This error does not show up as an error so I added a console.log with a formattedErrorMessage every time someone deletes something so it is easy to check the status message of the deletion operation. This should be a code of 200.

- Player Won't Load For New Song - Bug caused by Spotify Embed player causing a failure to rebuild the element when it is already there. Fixed this by getting rid of the page redirect in createSampleUriCookie server action, and adding location.reload after calling createSampleUriCookie from the onClick event handler in the trackURI button. I also had to create an inner async function inside the anonymous function so I could await createSampleUriCookie before the location.reload was triggered otherwise the page would reload before the cookie was created.

- Playlist GET Request 100 Track Max - Bug caused by the Spotify get playlist items endpoint maxing out at 100 items. To fix this I made the fetch a reciprocol function to call it enough times to get all items from any playlist. Similarly I had to call a playlist update and then add batches of 100 tracks to get around the 100 item limitation on the update playlist items endpoint.

Things Coming:
1. More search point options.
2. Ability to play songs.
3. Cleaner looking interace / better styling.
